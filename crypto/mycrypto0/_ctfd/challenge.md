(This challenge does not have `OWEEK{}` around the flag. Just submit the decoded message)

I have secrets to protect, so I've decided to implement a cipher to hide them.
The idea is that even if you could guess which cipher I'm using (and I'm using a
very famous one, so that's not a huge stretch), you would still be unable to decrypt
the message as you don't know the KEY.

So here's my message, there's no way you'll decode it, right?

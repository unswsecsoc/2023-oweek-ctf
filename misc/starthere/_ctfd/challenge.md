Welcome to Secsoc 2023 O-Week CTF! If you're not familiar with CTFs, they are usually
split into different categories depending on what you have to do to solve them.

**Do not do challenges in the order they appear on this page!** They are not necessarily
in order of difficulty, and if you are stuck, try a different challenge! You can always
come back to the challenge you were stuck on.

Here are some of the categories we have for this CTF:

- forensics: deals with the investigation of computer based data. In this case
  we give you different kinds of data and you have to figure out how to use
  the information we gave you to get a flag.
- recon: deals with using the internet to find out information. Sounds simple,
  but you'll soon see that it's not so easy üòâ
- web: deals with exploiting websites.
- crypto: deals with cryptography, which is about ciphers and encryption.
- reversing: typically consists of being given a computer program and trying to
  look at it from an attackers perspective.
- binary: generally deals with exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Binary and reversing are more technical categories (binary especially so), so we
recommend attempting other categories first!**

Finally, some general CTF tips:

1. Most of the time, you won't have all the information you need to solve each
   challenge. This is where research comes in. Cybersecurity is a very research
   heavy field [[citation needed](https://xkcd.com/285/)], so Google anything and
   everything that could help you learn more about the topic you are dealing with!
1. One of the biggest benefits of CTFs is their educational value. Don't be
   discouraged if you can't complete a challenge, once the CTF finishes we will
   release writeups so you can see the full solution
1. Have fun! If you don't like a challenge, you don't have to do it. Try a
   different one that interests you more! (unless you're going for a prize üòè)

Anyway, for the flag for this challenge, **submit the example flag used on the home
page of this site.** Good luck, and have fun!

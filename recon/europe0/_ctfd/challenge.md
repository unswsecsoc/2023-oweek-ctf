I've just been on a whirlwind tour through Europe - want to look at all the photos I took? Unfortunately, I can't seem to remember where I took any of them... If only someone could remind me!



Your answer should be the name of the square. You do not need to wrap your answer with OWEEK{}.

For example, a valid response may look like 'Times Square', without the quotation marks.

Note: Any of the europe chals can be done in any order!

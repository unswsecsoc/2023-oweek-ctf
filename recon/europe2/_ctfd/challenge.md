I hope you've got some street smarts, you'll need them to track this one down.



Your answer should be the name of the street pictured. You do not need to wrap your answer with OWEEK{}.

For example, a valid response may look like 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams', without the quotation marks.

Note: The europe chals can be completed in any order!

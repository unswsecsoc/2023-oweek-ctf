### Idea

View the source of the page to find the password

### Walkthrough

CTRL-U in most browsers will view the source of the page.
This reveals the password to be `very-secure-password` which can be used
in the password field to retrieve the flag.

### Flag

`OWEEK{w0w_u_know_th3_SEcr3t5_of_th3_s4uce_1h392}`
